What does fast-forward in Git mean?
The fast-forward is a merging technique in which Git fast forwards the master branch's pointer to match with the merged commits or with different branches.
In this, whole series of commits would be linear.

Why should you have different branches?
Branches help us in organizing our workflow in a more efficient way. By having different branches, teams can work together on different tasks and later they can test and merge their code with the main(master) branch. This ensures that the team is able to identify, fix bugs without hampering main(master) code.

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Ideally, we should have only one remote repository with mulltple branches.
